# A Grunt Project Template for Statically Hosted Sites

A streamlined web development project structure using Javascript, Sass, and Grunt. This is a project originally built for Motion Math's homepage at <http://motionmathgames.com>. 

## Getting Started

You'll need to install:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. [Bower](http://bower.io/)

3. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)


If you haven't used [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) before, be sure to check out the [Sass Basics](http://sass-lang.com/guide) guide.

The project comes set up for using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) along with Sass for styling.
